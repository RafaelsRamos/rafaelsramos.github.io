My journey as an Android Engineer on this project started in October 2021 and is still ongoing. For the most part it was a great!

Now that the introductions are complete, here are technologies that I've worked with, during these last 2 years:

### Kotlin & Java

As most Android projects, the backbone of this project was built on the solid foundation of Kotlin and Java, that allowed for clean, concise, and maintainable code.

### Android Views

The crafted user interfaces were achieved with Android Views.

### REST & GraphQL

Connecting the app to external services was a crucial aspect of this project.
I worked with both REST and GraphQL APIs to ensure smooth communication with the backend.

### GitLab

Version control is the heartbeat of any collaborative project. With GitLab, I managed code, tracked changes, and collaborated with team members effortlessly.

### RxJava

Handling asynchronous tasks was made elegant and efficient with RxJava. Its powerful reactive programming paradigm allowed for seamless event handling and data stream processing. This contributed to a responsive and performant application, providing users with a smooth experience.

### Glide

When it came to managing and displaying images, Glide was the go-to solution. Its high-performance image loading capabilities ensured quick and efficient handling of visual content.

That's a snapshot of the technologies that powered this project. Each component played a vital role in building this robust, user-centric application.

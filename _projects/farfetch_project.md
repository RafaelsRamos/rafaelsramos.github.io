My journey as an Android Engineer on this project started in October 2021 and is still ongoing. For the most part, it was great!

Now that the introductions are complete, here are technologies that I've worked with, during these last 2 years:

<br>

| **Skill** | **Purpose** |
|---|---|
| Java & Kotlin | Backbone of the project |
| Android Views | User interfaces creation |
| REST | Main communication style with the backend |
| GraphQL | Occasional communication style with backend |
| Retrofit | Facilitate REST API consumption |
| RxJava | Asynchronous operations |
| Glide | Image loading |
| Gitlab | Version control |
| Jira | Issue tracking |
| Confluence | Documentation |

# ITSector

ITSector is a Software Development company that specializes in the financial industry.

Through ITSector I was allocated as an Android Engineer to develop the Android Apps of [AtivoBank](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=wit.android.bcpBankingApp.activoBank&hl=pt_PT&pli=1) & [Millenium BCP](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=wit.android.bcpBankingApp.millennium&hl=pt_PT).

# AtivoBank & Millenium BCP

AtivoBank is a Portuguese digital bank founded in 2010, known for its user-friendly online banking services and innovative financial products.
Millennium BCP, on the other hand, is one of Portugal's largest commercial banks, established in 1985, offering a wide range of traditional banking services, including retail, corporate, and investment banking.

<br>

My journey as an Android Engineer on these projects started in January 2020 and finalized in September 2021.

These were the technologies that I worked with, during this period:

<br>

| **Skill** | **Purpose** |
|---|---|
| Java & Kotlin | Backbone of the project |
| Android Views | User interfaces creation |
| SOAP | Main communication style with the backend |
| Kotlin Coroutines | Asynchronous operations |
| Glide | Image loading |
| Azure DevOps | Issue tracking |
